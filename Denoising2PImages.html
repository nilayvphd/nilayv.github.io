												Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. 
												Cervical cancer is characterized by neoplastic growth of cervical cells 
												at the transformation zone of the endocervix and ectocervix<sup>1</sup>. Cervical 
												precancer originates from persistent infection with human papillomavirus 
												(HPV)<sup>1-3</sup>. HPV can induce cellular transformations which can lead to 
												dysplasia and cervical precancer but does not always result in precancer 
												development<sup>1,2</sup>. Cervical precancer is traditionally screened for using a 
												cytology-based Papanicolaou (Pap) smear exam and molecular-based HPV DNA 
												test<sup>1-3</sup>. In a Pap smear test, cells are collected from the cervix using 
												a spatula or brush and imaged using microscopy for abnormal cells<sup>3</sup>. If 
												abnormal cells and oncogenic HPV DNA are detected, patients undergo further 
												colposcopic examination<sup>3</sup>. Colposcopy involves low magnification imaging of 
												the cervix for dysplasia and collection of biopsies from the abnormal regions 
												of the cervix<sup>3</sup>. Biopsies are used to grade the lesion and determine 
												pre-cancerous status. If the biopsy is identified as pre-cancerous, 
												ablative (burning/freezing) or excisional (surgical excision) treatment 
												methods are used to remove the precancerous lesions<sup>3</sup>.

											<h3 style="color:black">Limitations in Clinical Nonlinear Optical Imaging</h3>
											<p style="color:black"> 
												Most clinical TPEF imaging has been conducted on skin with some endoscopic TPEF imaging<sup>13-17</sup>. 
												A key consideration in clinical TPEF imaging is fast image acquisition of high SNR data. In 
												preclinical studies, excised biopsies are plated on glass bottom dishes and imaged using a 
												high NA objective in a lab without major consideration of maximum permissible light dose and 
												motion artifacts<sup>18</sup>. Comparatively, in vivo imaging is expected to have motion artifacts from patients 
												and reduced irradiation parameters for safety, requiring high-speed imaging and lower illumination 
												powers. These two factors can significantly impact the acquired image SNR.
											</p>
											<p style="color:black"> 
												Current in vivo MPM imaging systems include the DermaInspect, MPTflex, and MPTcompact systems. 
												These systems utilize high NA=1.3 objectives to capture label-free TPEF images in patients<sup>19</sup>. 
												However, to accommodate the high NA objective, the systems are designed to be large and bulky, 
												limiting their use for clinical acquisition to external skin imaging. A micro-endoscope MPM system 
												with a NA=0.8 objective is also available but is limited by its collection optics that prevent 
												internal body use<sup>20</sup>.  As such, hardware improvements are still needed for endoscopic MPM imaging. 
												Further, software improvements are required to recover image quality from low SNR images to 
												account for the reduced illumination powers and potential motion artifacts.
											</p>
											<p style="color:black"> 
												In this project, we will focus specifically on software improvements for biologically relevant 
												image restoration of predictive metabolic metrics as an initial step. We aim to demonstrate the 
												recovery of image quality and morphofunctional metrics of metabolic activity using DL, which can 
												aid in the clinical translation of MPM.

										<h3 style="color:black">What is Two-Photon Excited Fluorescence Microscopy?</h3>

										<p style="color:black">
											Two-Photon excited fluorescence microscopy in a nonlinear optical imaging technique. 
											Nonlinear optical (NLO) imaging exploits nonlinear light matter interactions that 
											generally occur only at the focal plane, providing intrinsic depth sectioning<sup>4-6</sup>. 
											Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) is an NLO imaging technique that leverages the simultaneous 
											absorption of two or more low energy photons that arrive “simultaneously” at the fluorophore<sup>7</sup> . 
											Owing to the “simultaneous” absorption of low energy photons, the fluorophore achieves a greater 
											energy state<sup>5,7</sup>. After a short period of time, the molecule returns to its ground state; 
											however, due to the higher energy state from multiphoton excitation, the emitted fluorescence is of a 
											lower wavelength compared to the excitation wavelength<sup>5,7</sup>.
										</p>
										<p style="color:black">
											To generate nonlinear optical events, high-powered, ultrafast pulsed lasers 
											(on the order of femtoseconds) are used<sup>8</sup>. Multiple nonlinear optical processes 
											can be generated using these lasers; however, here, we focus specifically on Two-Photon 
											excited fluorescence (TPEF). 
										</p>
										<p style="color:black">
											TPEF is a process in which two photons are absorbed by atoms within a time window of 
											an attosecond (10-18 s), leading to the molecule reaching an excited electronic state<sup>9,10</sup>. 
											Quantum mechanically, a single photon is absorbed, bringing the atoms to a virtual 
											intermediate state before eventually reaching the final excited state by absorbing 
											a second photon<sup>9</sup>. Comparatively, in single-photon fluorescence (SPF), a single photon is 
											absorbed, causing atoms to reach their final excited state (Figure 1)<sup>9</sup>. After reaching 
											the final excited state, vibrational relaxation is observed in both SPF and TPEF before 
											the atoms return to their ground state, emitting a photon (fluorescence).
										</p>
										<p style="color:black">
											Another feature of TPEF is the highly confined three-dimensional excitation volume. 
											In SPF, excitation occurs along the entire axial plane constantly<sup>9</sup>.  However, in 
											TPEF, nonlinear excitation needs high photon flux (1020-1030 photons/cm<sup>2</sup><span>&#183;</span>s) which 
											is only satisfied near the focus (Figure 1)<sup>9,10</sup>. This feature of TPEF enables 
											intrinsic depth sectioning and minimized photobleaching in out-of-focus regions. 
										</p>
										<p style="color:black">	
											The final advantage of TPEF compared to SPF is that TPEF typically uses NIR wavelength 
											laser light sources compared to visible wavelength lasers used in SPF. The absorption and 
											scattering of light by tissue are greater in the visible wavelength regime, minimizing the 
											potential penetration depth of light into bulk tissue. NIR light enables deeper penetration 
											of light by reducing the number of scattering events and absorption of the low energy photons<sup>9</sup>. 
											Simultaneously, TPEF mimics behaviors of higher energy SPF allowing for the excitation of 
											endogenous fluorophores that typically require high-energy photon excitation. Further, since a 
											NIR illumination source is used to excite a fluorophore with emission in the visible region, 
											greater separation in excitation and emission bands exist, leading to a higher SNR signal<sup>9</sup>.

										<h3 style="color:black">Sources of Endogenous Contrast for Nonlinear Optical Imaging</h3>
										<p style="color:black">
											A variety of endogenous biomolecules can be visualized using TPEF in biological samples. These 
											fluorophores include Keratin, Retinol, LipDH, NAD(P)H, FAD, Melanin, Lipofuscin, and electron-transferring
											flavoprotein (ETF)<sup>4</sup>. Free, unbound FAD is a small portion of all FAD autofluorescence; the 
											majority of FAD signal is found within other flavoproteins like LipDH<sup>4</sup>. In the work described
											in this project, FAD is used interchangeably to describe autofluorescence detected from
											all flavin-associated proteins. 
										</p>
										<p style="color:black">	
											The most common sources of intracellular signal in TPEF are NAD(P)H and FAD<sup>4,6</sup>. Extracellularly, 
											collagen and elastin fibers contribute significant signals in TPEF due to crosslinking structures 
											within these proteins<sup>11,12</sup>. For all analyses of TPEF images in this project, NAD(P)H and 
											FAD signals are used, with collagen and elastin signals being masked. NAD(P)H is commonly excited 
											in TPEF using a 755 nm laser, and emission is collected at 460 ± 25 nm<sup>4,6</sup>. FAD is excited in TPEF 
											using a 860 nm laser, and emission is collected at 525 ± 25 nm<sup>4,6</sup>. These intrinsic contrast sources 
											have enabled the rapid translation of TPEF from the benchtop to clinical settings<sup>13-16</sup>.

										<h3 style="color:black">Application of Deep Learning to NLO Images</h3>
										<p style="color:black"> 
											Many ML and DL networks have been proposed for image restoration of biomedical images. 
											However, most proposed networks have been used to restore image quality in fluorescently stained samples. Exogenously 
											stained sample images feature higher SNR than label-free sample images owing to enhanced contrast from the fluorescence 
											stain. The same networks are not expected to have comparable performance on label-free images which have lower SNR.
										</p>
										<p style="color:black">	
											DL-enabled label-free image restoration was first explored by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-75172-9">Fast et al. (2020)</a> to enhance image contrast and 
											extend the scanning area of a custom in vivo MPM exoscope imaging system<sup>21</sup>. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-75172-9">Fast et al. (2020)</a> demonstrated 
											using the content aware image restoration and enhancement (CARE) network sub-micron lateral resolution with a 
											large field of view in a fraction of the time compared to current commercial MPM imaging systems (DermaInspect)<sup>21</sup>. 
											However, no metrics on image quality or model performance were provided. More recently, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41377-022-00768-x">Shen et al. (2022)</a> presented 
											alternative methods for DL-enabled label-free image restoration of TPEF images<sup>22</sup>. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41377-022-00768-x">Shen et al. (2022)</a> demonstrated using 
											a modified generative adversarial network (GAN) ~4.5 dB improvement in peak SNR (PSNR) and 79% improvement in structural 
											similarity index measure (SSIM), two metrics used to assess the quality of a noisy image compared to a clean/ground 
											truth image<sup>22</sup>. However, tissue images were collected from thin optical sections (OS), featuring consistent SNR between 
											each image compared to bulk tissue, where SNR is expected to decay as a function of depth. 
										</p>
										<p style="color:black">	
											<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41377-022-00768-x">Shen et al. (2022)</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-75172-9">Fast et al. (2020)</a> 
											are the only studies to examine DL-enabled restoration of label-free TPEF 
											images<sup>21,22</sup>. Despite the observed improvement in image quality after restoration, there is a lack of understanding 
											regarding the impact denoising has on biomedical metrics extracted from these images. Morphofunctional metrics of 
											metabolic activity show immense potential for sensitive (93.3%) and specific (83.3%) detection of cervical precancer<sup>18</sup>. 
											It is therefore imperative for DL algorithms to demonstrate recovery of not only image quality but also biomedical metrics. 
											In this project, we cover some of our early efforts to understand the impact of DL-based image restoration on 
											metabolic metric recovery compared to standard image quality metrics and explore how these models could be used for 
											clinical diagnosis of cervical pre-cancer. To read our published work click on the link below.
